            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>
                I am originally from the island of Puerto Rico, where I have lived for most of my life. It wasn't until 2018, when I got a job opportunity in Miami, and left the island to live in the states. It was hard to let go of friends and family but it was a career choice that benefit me at the time.
             </p>
             <p>I have been in the food beverage industry for over 20 years and I have enjoyed and hated it at the same time. It is what I went to school for, I even have a Master's degree in Hospitality Management. However, after 20 long and exhausting years I am ready to leave that life behind. I am looking forward to a better quality of life and better work/life balance. That is where programming comes in.</p>
             <P>I have many friends who do this for a living and they have all told me about the industry. I am very much intrigued and it is something that I have found to enjoy doing very much. Maybe, it is in my genes. After all, my father was also in the computer science industry all his career until he retired and he loved it. In fact, I remember as a child when he brought home one of the first desktop models for beta testing. In school I learned to code in QBasic, although I don't remember most of it and it doesn't really matter since it is an extinct language.</P>
             <p>Today, I am setting myself on a new career path in the programming world. I expect it to be a challengeing one and I wouldn't have it any other way. I also expect it to be lots of fun and exciting. Let's code!!</p>
